# hello-world
first repository, then a whole new life

Here is my github and my name is zhongzheng zhou, I have known github
for a long time, though it's the first time I create the repository and 
branches. I am a college student with a little dream, feel puzzled about
every choices I make, sometimes doubt myself. However, everything will 
come to an end, you have to make a choice, may we have a good beginning.
